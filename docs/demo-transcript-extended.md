## Pre-Meeting Context

Sarah Chen (CFO) received an email earlier that morning from what appeared to be CEO David Mitchell's email address, requesting an urgent video call about "a confidential acquisition opportunity." The email mentioned that "the board met in an emergency session last night" and stressed the need for discretion.

═══ PHASE 1: ESTABLISHING LEGITIMACY (Normal conversation) ═══

00:00:00     [System]            Meeting started                                         -

00:00:08     "David Mitchell"    Sarah, good morning. Thanks for making time             5%
                                 on such short notice. I know you had the
                                 quarterly review prep on your calendar.

00:00:22     Sarah Chen          Of course, David. Your email sounded urgent.            3%
                                 What's going on?

00:00:35     "David Mitchell"    Before I get into it, how did the preliminary           4%
                                 numbers look for Q4? I've been so buried in
                                 this other matter I haven't had a chance to
                                 review them.

00:00:52     Sarah Chen          We're tracking about 3% above forecast.                 2%
                                 Strong performance from the APAC region.

00:01:08     "David Mitchell"    That's excellent news. The board will be                6%
                                 pleased. Speaking of which, that's actually
                                 related to why I called...

═══ PHASE 2: BUILDING THE NARRATIVE (Introducing the "opportunity") ═══

00:01:25     "David Mitchell"    We've been presented with an acquisition                8%
                                 opportunity that's highly time-sensitive.
                                 A smaller competitor in the APAC market—
                                 exactly where we're seeing that growth.

00:01:48     Sarah Chen          Which company? I wasn't aware we had any                5%
                                 active M&A discussions in that region.

00:02:05     "David Mitchell"    It's been under wraps. Only the board and               12%
                                 myself have been involved so far. The target
                                 is TechVenture Asia. You may have seen them
                                 in industry reports.
                                 [DeepSafe: Minor anomaly - video latency detected]

00:02:28     Sarah Chen          I'm familiar with them. They have some                  4%
                                 interesting IP. What's the timeline looking like?

00:02:45     "David Mitchell"    That's the challenge. Their founder wants to            15%
                                 move quickly. He's had other offers and
                                 apparently needs an answer by end of day.
                                 The board authorized me to proceed last night.

00:03:08     Sarah Chen          An emergency board session? I didn't see                8%
                                 anything come through on the board portal.

00:03:22     "David Mitchell"    It was a quick call, very informal. You know           18%
                                 how Richard and the others are—they trust my
                                 judgment on these things. We'll file the
                                 formal documentation after the fact.
                                 [FLAGGED: Board process irregularity]

═══ PHASE 3: THE ASK (Introducing the financial request) ═══

00:03:45     "David Mitchell"    Here's where I need your help. To secure               25%
                                 exclusivity, we need to wire a good-faith
                                 deposit. It's a standard practice in
                                 competitive acquisition situations.

00:04:02     Sarah Chen          How much are we talking about?                          6%

00:04:12     "David Mitchell"    $250,000. It's fully refundable if the deal            32%
                                 falls through, and it'll be applied to the
                                 final purchase price otherwise. Really just
                                 a show of serious intent.

00:04:35     Sarah Chen          That should go through our standard wire                8%
                                 authorization process. I can initiate the
                                 request and have it approved by end of week.

00:04:52     "David Mitchell"    That's the problem, Sarah. We don't have               45%
                                 until end of week. The founder is meeting
                                 with another buyer tomorrow morning. If we
                                 don't have the deposit in his account by
                                 5 PM today, we lose exclusivity.

═══ PHASE 4: OVERCOMING OBJECTIONS (Pressure tactics begin) ═══

00:05:18     Sarah Chen          David, a same-day wire for a quarter million           12%
                                 dollars... that's outside our normal controls.
                                 I'd need to loop in legal, at minimum.

00:05:38     "David Mitchell"    I understand your concern, and normally I'd            58%
                                 agree completely. But this is exactly the kind
                                 of situation where we need to move fast.
                                 Remember the Nexus deal we lost last year?
                                 Same thing—we moved too slowly.
                                 [FLAGGED: Authority bypass attempt (72%)]

00:06:05     Sarah Chen          That was a different situation. We had due             15%
                                 diligence concerns there.

00:06:18     "David Mitchell"    And those concerns turned out to be unfounded.         62%
                                 Nexus is now worth three times what they were
                                 asking. I don't want us to make the same
                                 mistake twice. The board feels the same way.

00:06:42     Sarah Chen          Can I at least see the term sheet? Or talk             18%
                                 to someone from the board directly?

00:06:55     "David Mitchell"    I'll send you the term sheet right after this          68%
                                 call. As for the board, they've authorized me
                                 to handle this. Richard specifically said he
                                 didn't want to be bothered with the details—
                                 he trusts our judgment.

                                 you and authorize it myself, which frankly
                                 isn't how I wanted to handle this.

|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Legitimacy Building** | Small talk about Q4 numbers, referencing real company events | Not flagged (normal behavior) |
| **Authority Claim** | "The board authorized me", "Richard trusts my judgment" | 00:03:22 (18% risk) |
| **Urgency Creation** | "By 5 PM today", "The clock is ticking" | 00:04:52 (45% risk) |
| **Process Bypass** | "Document everything after the fact", "Go around you" | 00:08:12 (78% risk) |
| **Isolation** | "Keep this between us", "I don't want word getting out" | 00:09:02 (88% risk) |
